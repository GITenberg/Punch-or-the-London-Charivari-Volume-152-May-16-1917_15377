    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>Several factories where counterfeit bread tickets were
    printed have been discovered in Berlin. We understand that the
    defence will be that the tickets were only intended to be
    exchanged for counterfeit bread.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"The enemies' desire," says <span class="sc">King
    Ludwig</span> of Bavaria, "will he dashed to pieces against our
    troops, who are accustomed to victory." A number of the victors
    who are now eating themselves in behind our positions profess
    to be absolutely nauseated with it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Five million four hundred thousand pigs, says Herr
    <span class="sc">Batocki</span>, have "mysteriously
    disappeared" in Germany in the last year. The idea of having
    the <span class="sc">Crown Prince's</span> baggage searched
    does not seem to have been found feasible.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A festival performance of <i>Parsifal</i> is to be given in
    Charlottenburg, to celebrate the anniversary of the Battle of
    Jutland. The proposal to substitute the more topical opera,
    <i>The Flying Deutschmann</i>, has been received without
    favour.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"With such troops," says the <span class="sc">Crown
    Prince</span>, "we could fetch the Devil from Hell." We have
    always maintained that the German military route lay on a
    direct line to Potsdam.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Manchester man writes to say that he has not heard the
    cuckoo this year. What England hears to-day Manchester may hear
    next month.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Norfolk lady has left an annuity of seventy pounds for the
    support of her two favourite cats. Since the announcement of
    this windfall we understand that the beneficiaries have been
    overwhelmed with offers of marriage.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"The bascules of the Tower Bridge were lifted 3,354 times
    last year," says a news item. Yet there are those who pretend
    that petty crime is on the decrease.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Arundel proposes to have a house-to-house collection of
    bones. The Borough Engineer is understood to be completing
    specifications for a dog-proof trouser which will be a part of
    the collector's uniform.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Islington Borough Council report that in the Lady Day
    quarter only ten per cent, of the residents had removed without
    paying their rates. The inhabitants of the New Cut now accuse
    Islington residents of losing their nerve.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Ipswich," says a daily paper, "is fighting a rat plague by
    putting a penny on the head of every rat captured in the
    borough." The arrangement with birds is of course different,
    You put salt on their tails and capture them afterwards.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The new restrictions on the use of starch will, says Captain
    <span class="sc">Bathurst</span>, affect the wearing of
    starched garments. It is expected that in the House of Lords
    Lord <span class="sc">Spenser</span> and Lord
    <span class="sc">Harcourt</span> will join in an impassioned
    plea that, until the shortage grows more acute, really
    well-dressed men should be allowed to compromise on stiff
    dickeys.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Owing to the surveyor receiving increased powers the work of
    conscientious objectors on the roads in East Essex has
    improved. Mr. <span class="sc">Outhwaite</span>, we hear, will
    ask in Parliament whether under these powers the surveyor has
    actually threatened to give one conscientious objector a good
    hard slap.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We understand that Mexico has promised to stand by America
    on condition that if she takes this step on the side of law and
    order America will raise no objection to her having a
    revolution now and then just to keep her hand in.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Allotment-holders in all parts of the country say that their
    gardens need rain very badly, and <i>The Daily Mail</i> is
    going to take the matter up.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It was stated by a defendant at Wandsworth County Court that
    his house was haunted, the bell being rung several times
    without any visible human instrumentality. The "Hidden Hand"
    again!</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>To enjoy good health, says Dr. <span class="sc">A.
    Fisher</span> in an American journal, we should occasionally
    sleep for twelve hours on end. We confess that we may be faddy
    in these things, but when sleeping we prefer the horizontal
    position.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"One hundred thousand tons of sugar is wasted each year,"
    says Mrs. <span class="sc">Peel</span>, "through being left in
    the bottom of the teacup." A correspondent points out that if
    that amount has ever been left in the bottom of his teacup it
    was an oversight.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The German people, says the <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i>, will
    not soon forget what they owe to their future Emperor. The
    <span class="sc">Crown Prince</span>, while thanking them for
    their kindly intention, privately expressed a wish that they
    would not keep rubbing it in.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>According to <i>The Express</i>, every British theatrical
    star who plays in America is regarded as the best that England
    has ever sent out. Until he has heard from Mr.

    <span class="sc">Herbert Tree</span> is holding back his
    message, which reads, "That is so."</p>

    <h2>HEREINAFTERS.</h2>

    <h3>I.</h3>

    <p>There are people in the world called tenants. I think
    nothing of them; Celia thinks nothing of them; jointly we do
    not think anything of them. However, as this is not so much a
    grammar as an explanation, I will get on with it.</p>

    <p>For the last two years we have been letting our flat.
    Naturally Celia has had to do most of the work; my military
    duties have prevented me from taking my share of it. I have
    been so busy, off and on, inspecting my fellow-soldiers' feet,
    seeing their boots mended and imploring them to get their hair
    cut that I have had no time for purely domestic matters. Celia
    has let the flat; I have merely allotted the praise or blame
    afterwards. I have also, of course, taken the money.</p>

    <p>Our tenants have varied, but they are all alike in this.
    They think much more of their own comfort as tenants than of
    our happiness as landlords. They are always wanting things done
    for them. When they want things done for them, then I am firm.
    Celia may be a shade the more businesslike of the two, but I am
    the firmer. I am adamant.</p>

    <p>Take the case of Mr. Toots. As the wife of an officer
    proceeding overseas, Celia let the flat to Mr. Toots at the
    nominal rental of practically nothing a week. I said it was too
    little when I heard of it, but it was then too late&mdash;Celia
    had already been referred to hereinafter as the landlord. When
    he had been established some weeks Mr. Toots wrote to say that
    he wanted seven different kinds of wine-glasses, six of each.
    Personally I wanted seven different kinds of Keating's Powder
    just then; tastes differ. The trouble with Mr. Toots was that
    for some reason he expected Celia to supply the glasses.
    Whether he only wanted them during his tenancy or meant to keep
    them afterwards, we never knew. In any case Celia was
    businesslike; she wrote regretting that she could not supply
    them.</p>

    <p>But I was firm. I sent a picture-postcard of the champagne
    country, which said quite simply, "You must not drink wine
    during the War. My husband's milk-glass is in the corner
    cupboard."</p>

    <p>Again, take the case of Mr. and Mrs. Winkle. After getting
    the flat practically presented to them for a small weekly
    bonus, they suggest that they should only pay half terms during
    the summer, as they wish to take the children to the seaside.
    Celia was for telegraphing to say that it was impossible. For
    myself I have just written the following letter:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"<span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Could I consult
        my own feelings I would say, 'Pay no rent at all during the
        summer. Further, why not sub-let the flat to any of your
        own friends who can afford to give you a few guineas a week
        for it? Nay more, let <i>me</i> have the privilege of
        paying your expenses at the Sunny South. What do you say to
        the Métropole at Brighton?' But, alas, I cannot speak thus;
        there are others to think of. The King of
        <span class="sc">Greece</span>, President
        <span class="sc">Wilson</span>, Marshal
        <span class="sc">Joffre</span>&mdash;I need say no more.
        You understand. Things will have to go on as they are,
        except that the rent will probably be doubled about
        July.</p>

        <p class="ctr">Yours admiringly."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This letter is now waiting to go off. Celia says it is
    waiting for a stamp. Personally I don't see the necessity for a
    stamp.</p>

    <h3>II.</h3>

    <p>There are people in the world called owners. I think nothing
    of them; Celia thinks nothing of them; jointly we do not think
    anything of them. However, as I said before, this is not a
    grammar.</p>

    <p>For the last two years we have been renting cottages.
    Naturally Celia has had to do most of the work; the cut and
    thrust of a soldier's life has prevented me from taking my
    share of it. I have been so busy, off and on, seeing that my
    fellow-soldiers have baths, getting them shaved and entreating
    them to send their socks to the wash that I have had no time
    for domestic trifles. Celia has taken the cottage; I have
    merely allotted the praise or blame afterwards. I have also, of
    course, paid the money.</p>

    <p>Our landlords have varied, but they are all alike in this.
    They think much more of their own comfort as landlords than of
    our happiness as tenants. They are always wanting things done
    for them. When they want things done for them, then I am firm.
    Indeed I am granite.</p>

    <p>Take the case of Mr. Perkins, who owns our present cottage.
    Celia borrowed the cottage from Mr. Perkins at a rental of
    several thousands a week. I said it was too much when I heard
    of it; but it was then too late&mdash;she had already been
    referred to hereinafter as the tenant. As soon as we got in we
    began to make it look more like a cottage; that is to say, we
    accidentally dropped the aspidistra out of the window, lost the
    chiffonier, removed most of the obstacles and entanglements
    from the drawing-room to the box-room, and replaced the lace
    curtains with chintzes. In the same spirit of altruism we
    improved the bedrooms. At the end of a week we had given Mr.
    Perkins a cottage of which any man might be proud.</p>

    <p>But there is no pleasing some people. A closer examination
    of the lease, in the hope that we had over-counted the noughts
    in the rental, revealed to us the following:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"At the expiration of the said tenancy, all furniture and
    effects will be delivered up by the tenant in the same rooms
    and positions in which they were found."</p>

    <p>Not a word of thanks, you notice, for the new avenues of
    beauty which we had opened out for him; no gratitude for the
    great revelation that art was not bounded by aspidistras nor
    comfort by chiffoniers; nothing but that old reactionary spirit
    to which, if I may speak of lesser things, the Russian
    Revolution was due. Like Mr. Perkins, the Bourbons learned
    nothing and forgot nothing.</p>

    <p>Naturally I wrote to Mr. Perkins:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"<span class="sc">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I regret to
        inform you that the aspidistra has perished. It never took
        kindly to us and started wilting on the second day. As
        regards other <i>objets d'art</i> once in the drawing-room,
        but now seeking the seclusion of the box-room, we are in a
        little difficulty. Before letting it go my wife took the
        bearing of the marble how-now from the bamboo what-not and
        made it 28° 20', quite forgetting, unfortunately, that the
        what-not had also decided to lie fallow for a season.
        Consequently, while the direction of the what-not-how-now
        line is definitely fixed, their actual positions remain
        unestablished. Is it too much to hope that when the time
        comes for them to seek again the purer air of the
        drawing-room they will be able to rely upon the guidance of
        an old friend like yourself rather than upon that of two
        comparative strangers?</p>

        <p class="ctr">Yours anxiously."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>III.</h3>

    <p>Sometimes I wonder what Mr. Perkins would say if I suggested
    paying half-rent during the winter.</p>

    <p>Sometimes Celia wonders what she will say if she finds that
    Mrs. Winkle has re-arranged all her furniture for her.</p>

    <p>"We might," said Celia, looking at the two letters, "send
    the Perkins one to Mrs. Winkle and the Winkle one to Mr.
    Perkins."</p>

    <p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"Just to show how broad-minded we are," said Celia.</p>

    <h2>ON THE SPY-TRAIL.</h2>

    <p>Jimmy says he thought there must he something the matter
    with Jones minimus, he was so gloomy.</p>

    <p>He actually told Jimmy that he wished he was in heaven.
    Jimmy had to tell him not to say such wicked things, because
    sometimes when you wished things like that they came true, and
    then where would Jones minimus be?</p>

    <p>Jimmy says it takes a lot to make Jones minimus gloomy, but
    it turned out that he had lost the War Loan; he had either lost
    or mislaid it, he told Jimmy.</p>

    <p>It was on a card, and Jones minimus only wanted another
    shilling to make 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and then in five years
    they gave you one pound, and it was because of the compound
    interest someone invented.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says as they were talking the milkman came up and
    asked if they had seen his pig. The milkman is always losing
    his pig. Jimmy says it wanders off for a walk nearly every day
    talking to itself and going into gardens and relishing things.
    It is a very good relisher, Jimmy says.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says the milkman's pig is being talked about in home
    circles; but it doesn't seem to mind, it just goes on its
    way.</p>

    <p>You can always tell the milkman's pig by the black spot on
    its back.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says he knows a man who is going to shoot the pig at
    sight next time.</p>

    <p>Jimmy was just telling the milkman that he ought to put
    butter on its feet to make it stay at home, when Jones minimus
    suddenly remembered. He had put the War Loan in his algebra
    book and left it in Jimmy's garden. Jimmy says it was a good
    thing they went back when they did, because when he got home he
    found his bloodhound, Faithful, busy suspecting a chimney-sweep
    of being a spy; he had done it to the chimney-sweep's trousers,
    Jimmy says.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says the chimney-sweep was doing bayonet exercises
    with his brush at Faithful and working his black face at
    him.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says the chimney-sweep had evidently never seen a
    prize bloodhound before, because when Jimmy came up he stood on
    guard, and in a frightened whisper said to him, "What is
    it?"</p>

    <p>Jimmy says the beads of perspiration stood on the
    chimney-sweep's face like ink. The chimney-sweep told Jimmy
    that he was travelling the country sweeping chimneys; but Jimmy
    said that they had already had theirs swept, because a cat got
    in their dining-room and Jimmy had put in his bloodhound to
    tell it to go out.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says they looked everywhere for the algebra book, but
    couldn't find it, and they were just giving up in despair when
    they heard Jimmy's bloodhound wrestling with something in his
    kennel, and there it was.</p>

    <p>Old Faithful had worked half-way through the algebra and was
    busy solving simultaneous equations whilst sitting on the War
    Loan.</p>

        <span class="sc">"'Indenburg's watchin' yer!"</span>
    </div>

    <p>Jimmy says his bloodhound looked so disappointed when they
    took the algebra book from him that Jones minimus gave it him
    back again, as he said it was no good to him, and perhaps
    Faithful would find out how to catch another German spy, or
    else how to make up the War Loan to 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

    <p>Jimmy says his bloodhound did enjoy the algebra, and the way
    he tackled several pages of harder problems made old Jones
    minimus's mouth water.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says Faithful had finished the problems and was just
    beginning to chew some quadratics when he looked up and there
    was the milkman's pig calmly standing in the garden next door,
    looking at him through the hedge and actually munching a piece
    of coal at him.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says it made his bloodhound chew algebra like
    anything, and when the pig began flapping his ears at him old
    Faithful had to go right into the far corner of his kennel and
    nurse his wrath.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says that bloodhounds have been known to kill a pig in
    a very short time; but the pig didn't seem to know this, when
    Jones minimus and Jimmy took hold of the kennel and shook out
    Faithful at him. Jimmy says the pig just turned on its heel and
    walked round the garden sampling things and inquiring into
    them.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says that Faithful is a good sampler too, and when the
    pig saw him they tried to sample each other. Faithful thought
    he was chasing the pig, and the pig thought he was chasing
    Faithful, and they did it in a ring on the lawn.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says he could see they were both working themselves
    up, because the pig went up to a standard rose-tree and
    scratched his back at Jimmy's bloodhound, whilst Faithful kept
    smelling the ground like anything.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says the pig is a sacred animal to the natives of some
    places, but it wasn't to the man who owned the garden; he came
    out and accused it of being there.</p>

    <p>Jimmy told him that if you placed a pig in the middle of a
    lake it always cut its throat when it tried to swim out. But
    the man hadn't got a lake, he had only got an ornamental
    fountain, and the pig had already scratched that over with its
    back. The pig seemed very uneasy about its back, Jimmy
    says.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says the man offered Jones minimus a shilling if he
    would remove the pig and that piebald anteater from the garden
    in five minutes.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says Jones minimus is a very good pig-remover, and he
    thinks it must be a gift with him. Jimmy says the pig was very
    much surprised at Jones minimus, and it wanted to go home and
    get to bed.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says the pig trod on Faithful's toe as they both
    squeezed through the gate together, and Faithful pulled the
    pig's ear, and then they both went down the road, Faithful
    leading by about a yard, and looking behind him with both eyes
    to make sure the pig was following him. Jimmy says his
    bloodhound was working beautifully, and when the pig stopped to
    smell one end of a cabbage-stalk which was lying in the gutter
    old Faithful, with his nose to the ground, his ears hanging
    slightly forward, and his eyes looking upwards, crept slowly
    back and deliberately smelt at the other end. It was grand,
    Jimmy says. There they stood
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg
    317]</span> in silent contest for about five seconds, each
    trying to bend the other to his will, till the pig could stand
    the strain no longer, and, breaking away with all its strength,
    actually rushed into the garden of the man who had promised to
    shoot it at sight next time.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says you might have thought the pig owned the garden
    until the man came out. It rooted up wall-flowers and bit off
    tulips and browsed on some early peas and was making a regular
    meatless day of it, and then the man came rushing out with his
    gun.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says that he and Jones minimus had to duck down,
    because the man was so excited; he kept rushing about, talking
    about things and aiming his gun at the pig, and the pig kept
    running round and round and getting mixed up with Faithful.
    Then just as Jimmy was expecting the gun to go off the
    chimney-sweep suddenly came round some laurels from the back
    part of the house, with a bag of soot on his shoulders, and
    walked right into the middle of it all.</p>

    <p>Jimmy says the way his bloodhound had worked it all out made
    even Jones minimus gasp. There was the pig being puzzled at the
    chimney-sweep's face; there was the man with his
    double-barrelled gun pointed straight at the chimney-sweep, and
    there was the chimney-sweep, with both hands up in the air,
    shouting "Kamerad!" as hard as he could.</p>

    <p>Jones minimus couldn't get over it. To think that Jimmy's
    bloodhound had actually made up the War Loan to 15<i>s.</i>
    6<i>d.</i>, and caught a German spy at the same time, with
    nothing more to work with than a pig! Of course Jimmy knew how
    old Faithful had done it, but then he knew what a really prize
    bloodhound is capable of. It was the simultaneous equations, of
    course.</p>

    <h2>THE TWO CONSTABLES.</h2>

    <p>It happened one evening when my wife was staying away with
    her mother, in the dark months of last winter, when we were
    without servants, and I was glad to have received an invitation
    from my neighbour Jones to dinner.</p>

    <p>He and his wife welcomed me warmly, and their rather
    unintelligent maid had just brought in the saddle of
    mutton&mdash;a great weakness of mine&mdash;when we heard a
    firm knock on the hall door. She returned to say that someone
    wanted to speak to Mr. Brown immediately. "Who is it?" I
    demanded. "I don't know, Sir," said the girl, "but he looks
    like a policeman."</p>

    <p>"I hope nothing has happened to your wife," said Mrs. J.
    anxiously. "Or her mother," added Jones rather cynically.</p>

    <p>The man at the door was certainly a policeman, and an
    elderly one, and had probably been recalled from pension when
    the War broke out.</p>

    <p>"Good evening, Sir," he said, staring hard at me. "Are you
    Mr. Brown"&mdash;I nodded&mdash;"of Myrtle Villa, next
    door"&mdash;he eyed me suspiciously&mdash;"No. 17?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes," I said impatiently; "what of it?"</p>

    <p>"I must ask you for your name and address, Sir," pulling out
    his note-book, "for showing a strong light at the back of the
    'ouse at 8 P.M."</p>

    <p>"That's all nonsense," I answered impatiently; "the house is
    empty."</p>

    <p>"Excuse me, Sir, I saw it myself from the road at the back
    and came straight round," said he with his notebook ready.</p>

    <p>"But it can't be," I said, getting annoyed.</p>

    <p>At this moment a Special came running down the path.
    "They're coming," he panted.</p>

    <p>"Who are?" I asked. "No one's been invited but myself."</p>

    <p>"The engines."</p>

    <p>"But I haven't ordered any," said I.</p>

    <p>"I gave the alarm myself," he added proudly.</p>

    <p>Jones's rather unintelligent maid had been standing by my
    side the whole time. "Excuse me, Sir," she said, "I don't know,
    but I think there's something wrong with your 'ouse&mdash;the
    little room at the back, where you sit and smoke of an evenin'.
    There's been a big light there for some time&mdash;a wobbly
    one. I don't know, Sir, but I think the 'ouse is a-fire."</p>

    <p>"<i>What?</i>" I yelled, and dashed aside the two varieties
    of constabulary. Yes, it was all true. The strong light at the
    back of the house&mdash;a wobbly one&mdash;was rapidly becoming
    a glow in the heavens, as they say in journalese. I stood and
    looked at it, staggered for the moment, when I heard a cheer
    and saw the engines coming. I dashed for my front-door, but
    found myself forcibly dragged back. It was the Special, who
    seemed to be having the time of his life.</p>

    <p>"No one allowed to enter a burning building," said he
    importantly.</p>

    <p>"But I must," I cried; "there are some valuable
    papers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"No one allowed to enter," he repeated firmly&mdash;he
    seemed to have learned it by heart&mdash;"except the firemen
    and police."</p>

    <p>"Well, you go in and get them then. I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Pass along, please," he said quite suddenly, as a new phase
    of his duties seemed to occur to him, and I found myself edged
    back towards the crowd.</p>

    <p>Now I had to have those papers, and an idea occurred to me,
    so I stopped. "I say, how about your dinner? You'll miss it
    altogether. I don't want to keep you. Perhaps if you hurry off
    at once&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Dinner," he cried indignantly, gripping me fiercely by the
    arm&mdash;"what is dinner compared with duty? Do you know, man,
    I've been doing this bally Special business for over two years
    and never had a case yet, and now that I've got a real
    fire&mdash;and this is my own fire, mind you, my very
    own&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I thought it was mine," I ventured.</p>

    <p>"You talk to me of dinner! Pass right along, please;" and I
    found myself back among the crowd, who seemed to be thoroughly
    enjoying it.</p>

    <p>There was a small cheer just then as the flames came through
    the roof. Of Jones and his wife I saw nothing, but supposed
    they must have stayed on to enjoy their saddle of mutton, and
    wondered if they had kept mine hot for me. I could have kept it
    hot in my own house, I reflected rather miserably.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The fire had been extinguished. As the crowd dispersed I
    felt a touch on my shoulder. It was the elderly constable,
    note-book in hand. "You are Mr. Brown, Sir, of Myrtle Villa?"
    he inquired patiently. "I haven't had your name and address
    yet, Sir, for showing an unguarded light at the rear of the
    premises at 8 P.M."</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, May 7th</i>.&mdash;The Royal House has found an
    unexpected defender in Mr. <span class="sc">Outhwaite</span>.
    He alone has perceived the hidden danger underlying the recent
    proposal of the Lower House of Convocation to restore
    <span class="sc">King Charles I</span>. to his old place in the
    Church Calendar. This, he considers, is a direct encouragement
    to the persons who seek the restoration of the Stuart dynasty,
    and would make Prince <span class="sc">Rupprecht</span> of
    Bavaria heir-apparent to the British Throne. The House was
    relieved to hear from Mr. <span class="sc">Brace</span> that
    there was no immediate danger of this contingency. Indeed,
    Prince <span class="sc">Rupprecht</span> has had so much
    trouble already with his prospective subjects that he has
    probably no desire for their closer acquaintance.</p>

    <p>Sir <span class="sc">Leo Chiozza Money</span> is ordinarily
    a chirpy little person, quite able to take care of himself. But
    he was obviously depressed by his inability to furnish a
    plausible reason why two food-ships, having arrived safely in
    home ports, should have been sent away undischarged, with the
    result that they were torpedoed and their cargoes lost. The
    statement that he was "still inquiring" brought no comfort to
    the House of (Short) Commons. Why doesn't the
    <span class="sc">Shipping Controller</span> organise a Flying
    Squadron of dock-labourers?</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, May 8th</i>.&mdash;The official reticence
    regarding the names and exploits of our airmen was the subject
    of much complaint. Mr. <span class="sc">Macpherson</span>
    declared that it was quite in accordance with the wishes of the
    R.F.C. themselves. But Sir <span class="sc">H. Dalziel</span>
    was still dissatisfied. He knew of a young lieutenant who had
    brought down forty enemy machines and been personally
    congratulated by the Commander-in-Chief, and yet his name was
    not published. It is obvious that praise even from Sir
    <span class="sc">Douglas Haig</span> is not the same thing as a
    paragraph in <i>Reynolds' Newspaper</i>.</p>

    <p>A request for an increased boot-allowance to the
    Metropolitan Police met with a dubious reception from Mr.
    <span class="sc">Brace</span>, who explained that it would
    involve an expenditure of many thousands of pounds. It is
    rumoured that the Home Office is considering the recruitment of
    a Bantam Force, with a view to reducing the acreage of leather
    required.</p>

        <p class="sc">Beau Brummel Billing gives the "No-starch"
        movement a good send-off.</p>
    </div>

    <p><i>Wednesday, May 9th</i>.&mdash;If the
    <span class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span> should be
    accused of having taken advantage of his knowledge of the
    Budget-proposals to lay in a secret hoard of tobacco he will
    have no one to blame but himself. He solemnly assured the House
    that nothing has been brought to his notice to show that the
    trade is making undue profits. It is clear, therefore, that he
    has not had occasion to go into a tobacconist's and ask for his
    favourite mixture, only to find that his three-half-penny tax
    has sent the price up by twopence.</p>

    <p>By prohibiting the manufacture of starch the Government has
    done something to please Mr.
    <span class="sc">Pemberton-Billing</span>. The hon. Member, who
    has always affected the "soft shirts that Sister Susie sews,"
    is flattered to think that he has set a fashion which must now
    become universal. When Captain
    <span class="sc">Bathurst</span>, falling into his humour,
    assured him that even <span class="sc">Beau Brummel</span>
    would accept the position with patriotic resignation, Mr.
    <span class="sc">Billing</span> felt that he had found his true
    vocation as an arbiter of taste.</p>

    <p>In moving a Vote of Credit for the unexampled sum of five
    hundred millions, Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span>
    apologised for a slight error in his Budget statement. He had
    then estimated the expenditure of the country at five and a
    half millions a day. Owing to fortuitous circumstances, the
    amount for the first thirty-five days of the financial year had
    turned out to be seven and a half millions a day. Mr.
    <span class="sc">Mckenna</span>, conscious of some similar
    lapses in calculation during his own time at the Exchequer,
    handsomely condoned the mistake. Still one felt that it
    strengthened the stentorian plea for economy made by Mr. J.A.R.
    <span class="sc">Marriott</span> in a maiden speech that would
    perhaps have been better if it had not been quite so good. The
    House is accustomed to a little hesitation in its novices and
    does not like to be lectured even by an Oxford don.</p>

        <p class="sc"><i>Winston.</i> "No report of speeches. It
        hardly seems worth while."</p>
    </div>

    <p>The debate produced a number of speeches more suitable for
    the Secret Session that was to follow. Our enemies will surely
    be heartened when they read the criticisms passed by Mr.
    <span class="sc">George Lambert</span>, an ex-Minister of the
    Crown, upon our Naval policy, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg
    323]</span> by Mr. <span class="sc">Dillon On</span> the
    Salonika Expedition; and they will not understand that the one
    is dominated by the belief that no Board of Admiralty that does
    not include Lord <span class="sc">Fisher</span> can possibly be
    efficient; and that the other is congenitally unable to believe
    anything good of British administration in Ireland or
    elsewhere.</p>

    <p>For once Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span> took the
    gloves off to Mr. <span class="sc">Dillon</span>, and told him
    plainly that more attention would be paid to his criticism if
    he was himself doing something to help in the prosecution of
    the War.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, May 10th</i>.&mdash;I gather from Mr.
    <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> report of the Secret Session
    that nothing sensational was revealed. The
    <span class="sc">Prime Minister's</span> "encouraging account
    of the methods adopted to meet the submarine attack" was not
    much more explicit, I infer, than the speech which Lord
    <span class="sc">Curzon</span> was making simultaneously,
    <i>urbi et orbi</i>, in the House of Lords, or Mr.
    <span class="sc">Asquith</span> would not have
    observed&mdash;again I quote the official report&mdash;that
    "hardly anything had been said which could not have been said
    openly."</p>

    <p>That none of the Nationalists should have addressed the
    House was perhaps less due to their constitutional reticence
    than to the depressing effect of the South Longford election,
    where their nominee was defeated by the Sinn Fein
    candidate&mdash;one <span class="sc">Mcguinness</span>, and
    evidently a stout fellow. But it is odd to find that the debate
    was conducted without the assistance of Messrs.
    <span class="sc">Billing, Pringle</span> and
    <span class="sc">Hogge</span>. Their eloquent silence was a
    protest, no doubt, against the eviction of the reporters. Mr.
    <span class="sc">Churchill</span> was probably suffering equal
    anguish, but with patriotic self-sacrifice he refused to
    deprive his fellow-legislators of the privilege of hearing once
    again his views on the conduct of War.</p>

    <h2>ONE OF OUR DIFFICULTIES.</h2>

    <p>Under this title I refer to a lady whom I will call Mrs.
    Legion, for there are many of her all over the country, bless
    her conservative old heart. She has been in service as cook or
    cook-housekeeper most of her life (she is now getting on in
    years), and constant preoccupation with kitchen affairs has
    somewhat narrowed her outlook, so that the circumvention of the
    butcher, whose dominant idea (she believes) is to provide her
    with indifferent joints, is more to her than the defeat of
    <span class="sc">Hindenburg</span>; and so far as she is
    concerned the main theatre of the War is neither Europe nor the
    Atlantic, but the coal merchant's yard, which disgorges its
    treasure so grudgingly. Not only is her first thought for her
    cooking, in order&mdash;the transition to her second thought is
    automatic&mdash;that her employer or employers may be
    comfortable; but it is her last thought too.</p>

    <p>With such singleness of purpose to crystallize her, she
    cannot absorb even the gravest of warnings; not from
    unwillingness or stupid obstinacy, but from sheer inability to
    grasp any novelty. That her beloved master and
    mistress&mdash;either or both&mdash;should not have the best of
    everything and plenty of it is, at this advanced stage in her
    career, unthinkable. Even though she read it in print she would
    disregard it, for her attitude to them papers is sceptical;
    even Lord <span class="sc">Northcliffe</span>, with all his
    many voices, dulcet or commanding, has wooed in vain.</p>

    <p>I imagine that the milkman, from whom she heard of the War
    and whom she thinks (for his class) a sagacious fellow, has
    warned her against the Press. Anyway she has refused&mdash;and
    will, I fancy, never relent&mdash;to allow any extreme idea of
    food shortage to disturb her routine.</p>

    <p>"Look here, Mrs. Legion," you say, "really, you
    know"&mdash;you don't like, or you have lost the power, to be
    too firm with her after all these years of
    friendliness&mdash;"really we mustn't have toast any more."</p>

    <p>"Not toast!"</p>

    <p>"No, not any more. In fact"&mdash;a light laugh
    here&mdash;"I'm going to do without bread altogether
    directly."</p>

    <p>"Do without bread!" This with much more alarmed surprise
    than if you had declared your intention of forswearing
    clothes.</p>

    <p>"Yes; the Government want us to eat less bread. In fact we
    must, you know; and toast is particularly wasteful, they
    say."</p>

    <p>"There's no waste in this house, Sir [or 'M]." This with a
    touch of acerbity, for Mrs. Legion is not without pride. "No
    one can ever accuse me of waste. I'm not vain, but that I will
    say."</p>

    <p>"No, no," you hasten to reply, "of course not; but things
    have reached such a point, you know, that even the strictest
    economy and care have got to be made more strict. That's all.
    And toast has to be stopped, I'm afraid."</p>

    <p>"Very well, Sir [or 'M], if you wish it. But I can't say
    that I understand what it all means."</p>

    <p>And that evening, which is meatless and is given up largely
    to asparagus (just beginning, thank God!), you certainly see no
    toast in the rack, but find that the tender green faggot
    reposes on a slab of it large enough to feed several
    children.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Legion may go to church, but her real religion is
    concerned far more with her employers' bodies than with her own
    soul; and among the cardinal tenets of her faith is the
    necessity for dinner to be hot. You may have a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[pg
    325]</span> cold lunch, but everything at dinner must have been
    cooked especially for that meal, all circling about the joint,
    or a bird, like satellite suns.</p>

    <p>How to cleave such a rock of tradition? How to bring the old
    Tory into line with the new rules and yet not break her
    heart?</p>

    <p>"And, Mrs. Legion," you say, not too boldly, and at the end
    of some other remark, "we'll have yesterday's leg of mutton for
    dinner to-night, with a salad."</p>

    <p>"Cold mutton for dinner?" she replies dully.</p>

    <p>"Yes&mdash;now the weather's getting warmer it's much nicer.
    It will save coal too. Just the mutton and a salad. No
    potatoes."</p>

    <p>"No potatoes!" Surely the skies are falling, says her
    accent. You have been eating mashed potatoes, done with cream
    and a dash of beetroot in it, with cold meat, at lunch, for
    years.</p>

    <p>"No, no&mdash;we mustn't eat potatoes any more. Haven't you
    heard?"</p>

    <p>"I heard something about it, yes. But aren't we to eat those
    we've got?"</p>

    <p>"No, we must give them away. Remember, just cold mutton and
    salad. And no toast." You are getting more confidence. "Never
    toast any more"&mdash;another light laugh&mdash;"never any
    more!"</p>

    <p>And at dinner there are the cold mutton and salad all right;
    but to your horror you are asked first to eat a slice of salmon
    with two boiled potatoes.</p>

    <p>"Good heavens!" you say, "what's this?"</p>

    <p>"Well, Sir [or 'M], the fishmonger called, and as I felt
    sure the cold meat couldn't be enough for you...."</p>

    <p>Summoning all your courage you protest again, adding, "And
    another thing, Mrs. Legion; you mustn't make any more pastry.
    The flour can't be spared. It's not only bread we've got to be
    careful about, but everything made with flour."</p>

    <p>"Then what's the flour for?"</p>

    <p>"That's all right. But it's got to be saved."</p>

    <p>"I don't understand, Sir [or 'M]. I can't see why it
    shouldn't be used if we have it."</p>

    <p>"No. The idea is that every one should go without flour as
    much as possible, and then there will be more and it will last
    longer. More for other people."</p>

    <p>"My duty is to this house, Sir [or 'M]. But the flour's so
    coarse and brown it's hardly worth using, anyhow. I never saw
    such stuff. It's a scandal. But I'm truly sorry if I've
    disappointed you. All I want to do is my duty."</p>

    <p>"You have, Mrs. Legion, you have. You've been splendid; but
    the time has come now to eat less and to eat more simply. Is
    that clear?"</p>

    <p>"Well, I hear you right enough, Sir [or 'M], but I can't say
    I understand it. War or no war, I don't hold with folks being
    starved."</p>

    <p>And there it breaks off, only, of course, to begin
    again.</p>

    <p>That is Mrs. Legion!&mdash;one of the hardest nuts that Lord
    <span class="sc">Devonport</span> has to crack. She doesn't
    hold with Lords poking their noses into people's kitchens,
    anyway. That's not her idea of how Lords ought to behave. Lords
    not only ought to be gentlefolk, and be fed and waited upon and
    live in affluent idleness, but super-gentlefolk. But then she
    doesn't hold with many modern things. She doesn't (for one)
    hold with the War.</p>

    <h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

    <h3 class="sc">"Wanted A Husband."</h3>

    <p>You will easily guess that a comedy (or farce) in which a
    woman is reduced to advertising in the Press for a husband
    belongs to the ante-bellum era, before the glad eye of the
    flapper became a permanent feature of the landscape. Indeed Mr.
    <span class="sc">Cyril Harcourt's</span> play might belong to
    just any year since the time when women first began to write
    those purple tales of passion that are so bad for the morals of
    the servants' hall. It was simply to get copy for this kind of
    stuff that <i>Mabel Vere</i> (most improbably pretty in the
    person of Miss <span class="sc">Gladys Cooper</span>)
    advertised for a husband, for this post had already been
    assigned to the dullest and stuffiest of <i>fiancés</i>. I dare
    not think how the theme might have been treated in French
    hands, but Mr. <span class="sc">Harcourt</span> is very firm
    about the proprieties. My only fear was that the gallery might
    mistake his rather second-rate people for gentlefolk. In what
    kind of club, I wonder, do members reply to matrimonial
    advertisements and make bets about the result of their
    applications? I should be sorry to think that anybody
    attributes such conduct to the <i>habitués</i> of the
    Athenæum.</p>

        </table>
    </div>

    <p>The types that came to inspect <i>Mabel Vere</i> were
    sufficiently varied. There was a masterful Colonial (finally
    ejected by a lady-friend, who performed a jujitsu feat which
    required a very palpable collusion on his part); a butler; an
    Army Officer (with a reputation for exploring); a gay naval
    thruster, and an old gentleman who ought to have known better.
    To most of them she opposed an air of virgin superciliousness
    very disappointing to their justifiable anticipations; but the
    butler promised copy, and she accepted an invitation to tea in
    his kitchen. This scene furnished some very excellent and
    natural fun, and there was really no need to introduce, and
    exploit over and over again, the hallowed device of a trip-mat,
    that last resort of the bankrupt farceur. The necessary
    complications ensued with the unexpected arrival of the master
    (one of the candidates for the lady's hand, I need not say),
    who makes sudden demand for an early dinner, a thing impossible
    to execute with the cook in a fit of hysterics induced by
    jealousy of the lady who had supplanted her in the butler's
    perfidious affections.</p>

    <p>In the third Act we return to <i>Mabel's</i> flat and resume
    her interviews with the applicants for her hand. This revival
    of the situation of the First Act was a weakness in the
    construction. The original <i>fiancé</i>&mdash;a wooden dummy
    set up for the purpose of being knocked down&mdash;is
    dismissed, and <i>Captain Corkoran</i>, the bold explorer, is
    appointed to the vacancy. He deserved his luck; but, if I wish
    him joy of it, I do so without a pang of envy, for she was much
    too good at back-chat for a quiet life, to say nothing of her
    taste in literature, which would want a deal of correction.</p>

    <p>Of course Miss <span class="sc">Gladys Cooper</span> made
    her seem much more desirable than she really was. (I speak of
    her personal charm and not of her agreeable costumes, which are
    for the pens of more instructed reviewers. I got nothing out of
    a lady near me, whom I recognised as a dramatic critic by a
    question that her neighbour put to her. "Do you know this
    frock," she asked, "or will you have to go behind?") Apart from
    the delightful picture which Miss
    <span class="sc">Cooper</span> always presents she has a most
    swift and delicate feeling for the details of her craft. She
    has the confidence that avoids over-emphasis, and she does her
    audience the compliment of assuming that they have intelligence
    enough to understand the least of those little nods of hers
    that have the true eloquence of an under-statement. Mr.
    <span class="sc">Malcolm Cherry</span> was at his best and
    easiest as <i>Captain Corkoran</i>. Mr.
    <span class="sc">Hendrie</span> handled the broad humour of the
    butler with imperturbable restraint, and Miss
    <span class="sc">Barbara Gott</span> was as fine and human a
    cook as I ever wish to meet in her native lair. Miss
    <span class="sc">Margaret Fraser</span>, a most attractive
    figure, was a model for any housemaid on whose damask cheek the
    concealment of an unrequited passion for her master feeds like
    a worm i' th' bud. Altogether a really excellent cast.</p>

    <p>The humour of the dialogue was fresh and well sustained.
    Here and there Mr. <span class="sc">Harcourt</span> permitted
    himself allusive refinements which deserved a better response,
    as when <i>Captain Corkoran</i>, discussing with <i>Mabel</i>
    the menu of the dinner that she fails to cook for him, adapts
    the language of <span class="sc">Solomon</span> and says,
    "Fritter me apples, for I am sick of love." This was lost upon
    an audience insufficiently familiar with the works of that
    great voluptuary.</p>

    <h2>TASTY DISHES.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Food Specialist</i>.)</h4>

    <p>Mr. Punch considers it to be his duty at the present time to
    show how an abundance of excellent and nourishing food may be
    obtained from the most unlikely materials. In doing this he is
    aware that he is merely following the example set him by
    countless culinary experts, who have communicated their ideas
    to the daily press; but Mr. Punch is not to be deterred from
    doing a helpful action by any paltry jealousy as to precedence.
    His readers, he knows, will be grateful to him for his
    generosity.</p>

    <h3 class="sc">No. I.&mdash;For General Use.</h3>

    <p>Take two Committees&mdash;it is not absolutely necessary
    that they should meet more than once&mdash;and, having added to
    them a Chairman, stew on a slow fire until a Secretary emerges.
    Turn into an enamelled saucepan and set to simmer over gas.
    Then boil up twice into resolutions and votes of thanks, and
    let the whole toast for at least three hours. Sprinkle with
    amendments and add salt and pepper to taste. Then brown with a
    salamander and serve up hot in egg-cups.</p>

    <h3 class="sc">No. II.&mdash;For a Householder in Streatham or
    Camden Town.</h3>

    <p>To half a tennis-lawn add two ounces of croquet-mallet and
    three arches of pergola, and reduce the whole to a fine
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[pg
    327]</span> powder. Drench with still lemonade and boil into a
    thick paste. Add two hundredweight of dandelions and plantains
    together with at least three pounds of garden-roller and five
    yards of wire-netting carefully grilled. Let this be roasted
    and basted for an hour and then flavoured with vantage. Turn
    out into a mould, and serve overhand as fast as possible,
    having first shred into the mixture half a ton of daisies or
    buttercups, according to taste.</p>

    <h3 class="sc">No. III.&mdash;Beesting Jelly for
    Apiarians.</h3>

    <p>Catch one thousand bees and extract their stings. Then throw
    away the bees and lay the stings gently but firmly on a mash
    composed of the breasts of five Buff Orpington cockerels. Sift
    the whole through a fine cloth and add the yolks of a hundred
    poached eggs. Beat up together for an hour and ten minutes.
    Flavour with coffee and dilute with elderberry wine. Allow the
    mixture to simmer in a hot oven and serve with fresh asparagus
    cut before breakfast.</p>

    <h3 class="sc">No. IV.&mdash;Puntpole Pie for Riparian
    Owners.</h3>

    <p>Chop into small pieces three or four puntpoles, having first
    melted down the metal shoes, and spread thin over as many canoe
    paddles as can be obtained for the purpose. Immerse the whole
    suddenly in the river and dry before a quick fire. Add one
    boat's rudder and twenty-four dab-chicks, and season with three
    yards of grated swans' necks, six barbel, four dace and a dozen
    gudgeon, close time for these fish being strictly observed.
    Sprinkle with cowslips and willow leaves, insert in a pie-dish
    and cover with a thick paste of bulrushes and marsh grass. Then
    set to bake for three hours, and stick four pigeons' claws into
    the crust. Picnic baskets from which the salt has been omitted
    may be shredded over the surface instead of parsley.</p>

    <p>Mr. Punch has many more recipes equally cheap and excellent,
    and is prepared to disclose them to those of his readers who
    may desire to practise a rigid economy and at the same time to
    enjoy an abundance of good food.</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</h4>

    <p>A volume called <i>Curious Happenings</i>
    <span class="sc">(Mills and Boon)</span> can boast at least a
    highly attractive, open-and-see title; to which is added, in
    the present instance, a wrapper-picture of the most intriguing
    brand. Perhaps not quite all the contents of Miss
    <span class="sc">Marjorie Bowen's</span> book of short stories
    fully live up to the promise of its outside (what stories
    could?), but they have amongst them one, from which both title
    and picture are taken, of very unusual and haunting quality.
    So, if you should only be able to snatch so much time from work
    of National importance as suffices to read a single tale, begin
    at the start, and be assured of having the best. Not that the
    others are without their attractions, though one is rather
    gratuitously revolting. Laid in the picturesque eighteenth
    century, they all exhibit Miss <span class="sc">Bowen's</span>
    very pretty gift for costume-drama at its happiest. The trouble
    is that, with a volume of such short tales, stories of
    situation, one gets too familiar with the method&mdash;as, for
    example, in "The Folding Doors," where a lady's husband and
    lover had played out their scene before the closed doors (with
    an alleged cut finger for the husband), and I knew only too
    well in what state the flinging open of the doors would reveal
    the lady herself. But perhaps I am exceptionally cursed in this
    matter; and, anyhow, a volume that contains even one story so
    good as "The Pond" is a thing for gratitude and rejoicing.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I may have been wrong in turning to a novel for mental
    relief; anyhow, I have just come through one of the toughest
    bouts of relaxation I can remember, and my only solace for the
    slight weariness of such repose is the thought how much more
    tired the author, Mr. <span class="sc">Basil Creighton</span>,
    must be. With such a hail-storm of metaphor and epigram
    constantly dissolving in impalpable mist of mere words has he
    assaulted <i>The History of an Attraction</i>
    (<span class="sc">Chatto and Windus</span>) that the poor
    thing, atomised, vaporised and analysed to the bone, lies limp
    and lifeless between the covers, with hardly a decent rag of
    incident or story to cover it. And there one might perhaps be
    content to let it rest, but for the fact that <i>Anita</i>, the
    lady of the "Attraction," is worthy of a better fate. The
    principal man of the book, who, after much wobbling
    consideration, and in spite of his quite fortuitous marriage
    with some one else in the meantime, discovers at last that he
    does love <i>Anita</i>, is the merest peg on which to hang
    endless philosophisings; and so is his impossible wife
    <i>Janet</i> herself, the lady who, after having accepted his
    dubious courtship for no particular reason, fortunately deserts
    him without any better excuse, thus clearing the way for a most
    decorous divorce and readjustment. Neither is the writer's
    inner thesis&mdash;the immoralness of ordinary morality, so far
    as I can make out&mdash;particularly agreeable; but
    <i>Anita</i>, though far from being the sort of person one
    would look to meet in real life, is intriguing after a fashion,
    and just possibly repays the hard work needed for the making of
    her acquaintance.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Miss <span class="sc">M.E.F. Irwin</span>, whose previous
    books I remember to have greatly enjoyed, has produced for her
    third a story of much originality and power, called <i>Out of
    the House</i> (<span class="sc">Constable</span>). The title
    may perplex you at first. It comes from the struggles of the
    heroine to wrench herself free from encompassing family ties
    and the tradition of intermarriage, in order to join her life
    to the outside lover who calls to her. You might therefore
    consider it, in some sense, a story of eugenics, but that its
    outlook is emotional rather than scientific. Yet the
    <i>Pomfrets</i>, as a result of family pride and
    over-specialization, had become a sufficiently queer lot to
    warrant a normal girl in any violence of house-breaking to be
    free of them. Therein of course lies the cleverness of the
    book; it is full of atmosphere, and the atmosphere is full of
    dust, <i>Pomfret</i> dust. You can feel how heavy to rebellious
    lungs must have been the air of the <i>Pomfret</i> houses,
    where lived <i>Philip</i>, the intriguing father, and his sons
    <i>Anthony</i> (a little mad) and <i>Charles</i> (much more
    mad, but with at least the instincts of a lunatic gentleman).
    It is not, you will guess, precisely a lively tale, but the
    force of it is undeniable. Miss <span class="sc">Irwin</span>
    has now more than ever proved herself a fastidious and careful
    artist, with a touch of austerity that gives weight to a tale
    so frankly one of sentiment, and she will, I hope, continue to
    keep her work above the ordinary level.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>The Wane of Uxenden</i> (<span class="sc">Arnold</span>)
    seems to be one of those novels which may be classed as worthy
    in intention without being exactly happy in execution. Miss
    <span class="sc">Legge</span> has a desire to warn us all
    against the perils of monkeying with spiritism, and she has
    chosen the method of making it tiresome even to read about.
    Well, it is a method certainly. <i>Uxenden</i> was a nice old
    family, which had come down to cutting its timber while a rich
    Jewish soap-and-scent-manufacturer sat rubbing his hands on a
    slice of the property, waiting for the rest of it to come his
    way. <i>Uxenden</i> eventually waned entirely, and without
    tears so far as I was concerned. I feel sure <i>Mr. La Haye</i>
    (<i>né Levinstein</i>) would make a better landlord than the
    old squire, in spite of the prejudices of the countryside....
    No, I am afraid it would be stretching a point to promise you
    any great entertainment from this well-intentioned but rather
    woolly book. <i>Brother Jenkins</i>, the fraud, of the Society
    of Seven, is about the most entertaining of the
    marionettes.</p>

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
